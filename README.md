This project is an (incomplete yet functional) attempt to create a cli with commands to access (brazilian) stocks fundamental data such as earnings, P/E ratio, etc.

It used https://www.dadosdemercado.com.br/ API's and cached queries in a local postgresql database for convenience.


This was a personal project, so the tokens are hardcoded but not valid anymore.
